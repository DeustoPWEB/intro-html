GitHub Pages is now serving your web page at:
https://{{user.username}}.github.io/{{repo}}/

It's not very special looking, isn't it? Web hosts (and GitHub Pages) look for a file titled `index.html` and serve that up. Since there's no `index.html` file in our repository, GitHub Pages displays the contents of the README by default. Let's change this by adding the `index.html` file to our repository. Don't worry, we've taken care of the hard part.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add `index.html`

1. Create a pull request. You can either [use this direct link](https://github.com/{{ user.username }}/{{ repo }}/compare/master...add-index?expand=1), or go to the Code tab, click on New Pull Request, select base: master, and compare: add-index.
1. Add a descriptive title to your pull request, something like "Add the index.html file".
1. Add a descriptive body to you pull request.
1. Click **Create pull request**.
