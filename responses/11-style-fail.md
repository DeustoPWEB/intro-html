Uh oh, I didn't find the <link> tag inside the <head>! Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your spelling. We're checking specifically for the following: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`.
2. This must be after the opening `<head>` tag, and before the closing `</head>` tag.

Let's try again!

### :keyboard: Add the stylesheet

1. Click on **Files Changed**.
1. Click on the :pencil: to edit the file.
1. Add the link tag inside the `<head>` section of the index: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`
1. In the _Commit changes_ section, enter a commit message that describes what you've done.
1. Click on **Commit changes**.
