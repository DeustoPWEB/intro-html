This repository powers the Learning Lab course [_Introduction to HTML_](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html). 

Every Learning Lab course is made up of:

- a [template repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/intro-to-html-template)

The course repository is written in YAML and Markdown. The template repository could be written in any language that supports the learning objectives.
