<h1 align="center">Course: Introduction to HTML </h1>

This repository powers the Learning Lab course [_Introduction to HTML_](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html). 

Every Learning Lab course is made up of:
- a [course repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/intro-to-html/), and
- a [template repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/intro-to-html-template)

The course repository is written in YAML and Markdown. The template repository could be written in any language that supports the learning objectives.

For more information on the goals of this course, check out the [`course-details.md`](course-details.md).
