# Contributing 

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to a course on GitHub Learning Lab! :robot: :heart: :balloon: 

### Ways to contribute

We love contributions from the community. Here are just a few of the ways you can contribute:

- **Report bugs:** if you find a bug while taking the course, you may want to do a quick check of past issues to see if you can find any help there. Otherwise, create a new bug issue in this repository using the provided template. 
- **Answer questions:** check out the open issues in this repository and see if you can help answer learner questions. Learners also ask questions in the [GitHub community forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Learning-Lab/bd-p/learn)
- **Suggest changes:** this could come in the form of a new learning outcome, updates to the content, updates to the bot responses, or the logic of the course. If you'd like, you can fork the course and suggest the change that way, but most people like to talk about it first in an issue.
- **Tackle an issue:** if you see an issue you would like to resolve, please feel free to fork the course and submit a PR.
- **Translate a course:** if you have the ability to translate a course, we'd love to see it. Please fork the course and submit a PR. We'll need a second native speaker to confirm the translation so if you have anyone in mind, please @ mention them in your PR for a review.
